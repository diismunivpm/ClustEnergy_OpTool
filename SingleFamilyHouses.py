"""
The classes of Single-Family Houses (SFHs) are modeled below. 
    In particular, buildings with different age classes are considered, each characterized by a different degree of insulation. 
    With reference to the building types contained in the Tabula Project (Corrado et al., 2014), the following classes were considered:
                Class year of construction    	before-1970           	1971-1990	1991-2005    	2006-today
                Single-Family House archetype 	1946-1960             	1976-1990	1991-2005    	2006-today
                Thermal insulation level      	no thermal insulation 	low level	medium level 	high level
                
    To represent the energy demand of individual buildings, lumped-parameter modeling based on the thermoelectric analogy (RC networks) was adopted. 
    From the U values, RC values useful for modeling buildings with networks were calculated (see excel spreadsheet attached in the documentation). 
    In the tool, there are two different model architectures to represent dwelling archetypes. 
    One is for thermally insulated buildings (i.e., SFH 2006-present, SFH 1991-2005, and SFH 1976-1990). For each building envelope element, 
    the front side (layers from the insulation inward) and the back side (layers from the insulation outward) of the insulation are distinguished. 
    In buildings without thermal insulation (SFH 1946-1960), on the other hand, each component of the building envelope is represented by a single thermal node.
    
    Solar gains and internal gains are applied to nodes representing the building envelope. 
    Specifically, following the methodology described in ANSI/ASHRAE Standard 140 (ANSI/ASHRAE, 2020) (i.e., BESTEST) incident solar radiation is applied 
    to the nodes representing the exterior walls and roof. In contrast, the transmitted solar radiation and internal gains are assigned to the nodes 
    representing the internal surfaces. 
    The contribution of air systems is applied directly to the indoor air thermal node. 
    While, the contribution of the underfloor heating system is applied to the node representing the layers from pipes facing inward (Tfi,ap). 
    As a result, the energy dynamics of the building can be represented through the formulation of a state-space model.
