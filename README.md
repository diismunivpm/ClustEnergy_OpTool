# ClustEnergy_OpTool
Python tool for evaluating the energy flexibility offered by a user-defined cluster of buildings via optimized control.

ClustEnergy OpTool is a useful tool for evaluating the energy flexibility potential offered by an aggregate of buildings (e.g., cluster of buildings), which is useful for resource planning in future scenarios. 
It is a simple Python tool based on linear programming that allows simulation of different demand management strategies in different user-defined clusters of buildings. 
Through archetype-based approach, it is possible to define a representative cluster of buildings subjected to a demand management strategy during a simulation period and reference location. 
Then, from the comparison with a baseline scenario (BL), it is possible to study the flexible behavior of a cluster of buildings subjected to a demand response (DR) strategy. 
Specifically, through centralized optimal control, a peak shaving strategy or a load shifting strategy can be implemented. 
Although the currently available archetypes refer to the Italian case study, the tool given its simplicity is easily modified and adaptable to the needs of the individual use.
